We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards stratergies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure.

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies:

- [Terraform 0.12](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)






## Examples

**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-kms/releases).


### Simple Example
Here is an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "kms_key" {
    source                  = "git::https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-kms.git?ref=tags/0.12.3"
    name                    = "kms"
    application             = "clouddrove"
    environment             = "test"
    enabled     = true
    label_order             = ["environment", "application", "name"]
    description             = "KMS key for cloudtrail"
    deletion_window_in_days = 7
    enable_key_rotation     = true
    alias                   = "alias/cloudtrail"
    policy                  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.default.json
  }

  data "aws_iam_policy_document" "default" {
    version = "2012-10-17"
    statement {
      sid    = "Enable IAM User Permissions"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "AWS"
        identifiers = ["*"]
      }
      actions   = ["kms:*"]
      resources = ["*"]
    }
    statement {
      sid    = "Allow CloudTrail to encrypt logs"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "Service"
        identifiers = ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"]
      }
      actions   = ["kms:GenerateDataKey*"]
      resources = ["*"]
      condition {
        test     = "StringLike"
        variable = "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:cloudtrail:arn"
        values = ["arn:aws:cloudtrail:*:XXXXXXXXXXXX:trail/*"]
      }
    }

    statement {
      sid    = "Allow CloudTrail to describe key"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "Service"
        identifiers = ["cloudtrail.amazonaws.com"]
      }
      actions   = ["kms:DescribeKey"]
      resources = ["*"]
    }

    statement {
      sid    = "Allow principals in the account to decrypt log files"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "AWS"
        identifiers = ["*"]
      }
      actions   = [
                    "kms:Decrypt",
                    "kms:ReEncryptFrom"
      ]
      resources = ["*"]
      condition {
        test = "StringEquals"
        variable = "kms:CallerAccount"
        values = [
          "XXXXXXXXXXXX"]
      }
      condition {
          test     = "StringLike"
          variable = "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:cloudtrail:arn"
          values = ["arn:aws:cloudtrail:*:XXXXXXXXXXXX:trail/*"]
      }
    }

    statement {
      sid    = "Allow alias creation during setup"
      effect = "Allow"
      principals {
        type        = "AWS"
        identifiers = ["*"]
      }
      actions   = ["kms:CreateAlias"]
      resources = ["*"]
    }
  }

```

## Testing

In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system.

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
